	<p style="text-align: left;"><b>LLaVA-NeXT-M3</b>
		To edit image1 to make it look like image2, you would need to add a patterned cushion or seat cover to the bench. Here are the steps you might take:
		1. Select and clone: Use a photo editing tool to select the area around the dog and the bench. Then, use the clone tool to blend the background slightly so that it looks more natural.
		2. Add patterned cushion: Place a patterned cushion or seat cover over the bench where the dog is sitting. The pattern should match the color scheme of the dog's fur and the background, possibly with a floral or nature-inspired design.
		3. Adjust contrast and brightness: Adjust the contrast and brightness to match the lighting in image2. This will help the patterned cushion stand out against the dog and the background.
		4. Remove background noise: If there is any visible noise or graininess in the background, you can use a filter or a photo editing tool to remove it, making the image look cleaner.
		5. Finalize the edit: Review the edited image to ensure the patterned cushion blends well with the dog and the background. Make any final adjustments as needed.
		Remember, the goal is to create an image that looks like image2, which has a patterned cushion on the bench, while still maintaining the natural outdoor setting.</p>
